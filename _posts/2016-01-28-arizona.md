Arizona

A southwestern U.S. state, is best known for its reliably sunny weather and as home to the Grand Canyon, the mile-deep chasm carved by the Colorado River. Many visitors utilize Flagstaff, a Ponderosa Pine-covered mountain town, as a gateway to the Grand Canyon. Other natural features include the saguaro cactus-filled Sonoran Desert and the rugged formations of Red Rock State Park.
