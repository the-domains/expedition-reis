> Las Vegas, in Nevada's Mojave Desert, is a resort town famed for its buzzing energy, 24-hour casinos and endless entertainment options. Its focal point is the Strip, just over 4 miles long and lined with elaborate theme hotels such as the pyramid-shaped Luxor and the Venetian, complete with Grand Canal; luxury resorts including the Bellagio, set behind iconic dancing fountains; and innumerable casinos.
