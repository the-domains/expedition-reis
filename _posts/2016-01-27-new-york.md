New York

Home to the Empire State Building, Times Square, Statue of Liberty and other iconic sites, New York City is a fast-paced, globally influential center of art, culture, fashion and finance. The city's 5 boroughs sit where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean, with the island borough of Manhattan at the "Big Apple's" core.
